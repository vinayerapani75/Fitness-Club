<h1 align="center" style="color:powderblue;"> SINCE WE STARTED </h1>
<p> Gold's Gym International, Inc. is an American chain of international co-ed fitness centers (commonly referred to as gyms) originally started by Joe Gold in Venice Beach, California.  Our each gym offers a variety of cardio and strength training equipment as well as group exercise programs. Its headquarters have since relocated to Dallas.</p>
<h4 style="color:green;">Joe Gold opened the first Gold's gym in August 1965,in Venice Beach,California.</h4>
<p>They ran the gym for almost two years, and when they realized it was not feasible for them, they were going to close it and reopen the premises as an antiques shop. They offered it to a gym member, Ken Sprague, who purchased it in late 1971, and Gold's was saved as a gym. Sprague was the first owner of Gold's to actually sponsor and hold bodybuilding competitions, and his promotional skills and film industry contacts helped build the establishment's profile.</p>
